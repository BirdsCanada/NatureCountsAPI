# NatureCounts Mobile App API Verson 1.0 #

This set of entrypoints is designed to serve the needs of NatureCounts mobile app.

All queries are over HTTPS  as either GET or POST requests. Query responses are JSON object,
mostly structured as a 'data frame': attribute names are the data
field names, and attribute values are vectors of field values.

Use the following host to test against the current sandbox environment:

## Authentication and User Profile ##

User identification is accomplished by including a token as a request parameter. The
procedure to obtain a token is described below.

Note that user registration is supported through the website form available here:

[https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/register.jsp](https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/register.jsp)

Registration is free.


### Authentication ###

The API controls data access and submission using a token with a limited life span (currently 20 days).
Authentication is based on [NatureCounts login](https://www.birdscanada.org/birdmon/default/register.jsp).

A user may hold multiple valid tokens at a time, allowing them to work from more than one session (or device) at once.

This entrypoint requires a login username and password, and if valid, returns a JSON object carrying
a token with a 20 day validity period, as well as the current `api_version` designation (String).
The client application must then present the token as user credentials in subsequent entrypoints.

Required parameter: **username** - the account username

Required parameter: **password** - the account password

>**Example URL:** /api/mobile/authenticate?username=asdfasdf&password=qwerty

>**Example Response:** {"token":"1234567890qwerty,"api_version":"2019.01"}

Note that the api_version attribute can be used to validate future versions of the Mobile App.


### User Profile ###


Returns the profile associated with the token.

> /api/mobile/user?token=asdfasdf


**Return JSON attributes:**

| Attribute | Notes |
| --------- | ----- |
| login_name | The login name |
| last_name | The surname |
| first_name | The firstname |
| email | The email address |





### Project Registration ###

Project registration may require that the project administrator authorizes the registration.
A user's status in a project is returned as part of the response to the `/api/mobile/userProjects`
entrypoint (see below).

A user registration request is triggred by the following:

> /api/mobile/projectRegister?token=asdfasdf&projectId=95

| Parameter | Type | Required | Notes |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| token | String | Yes | The authentication token |
| projectId | Integer | Yes | The project to which the user will be registered |
| lang | String | No | A 2-letter language code, defaulting to EN |



## API and Data Version ##

Returns api and data version attributes.

> /api/mobile/dataVersion

Authenticated: No

**Return JSON attributes:**

| Attribute | Notes |
| --------- | ----- |
| api_version | The API version will normally not change, but may be used in future to signal stale Mobile App version |
| data_version | If this attribute changes, all cached Reference data should be updated before the user interacts with the App |

The `api_version` value can be used in future to validate Mobile App verson compatibility.

The `data_version` parameter should be stored and then used to signal that a cached data refresh is required. If the `data_version`
has changed, then all reference data should be updated. This will not occur frequently.



## API Last Modified Times Bundle ##

Returns a set of entrypoints and parameters that should be used to
refresh local cache with modified data.


**Precise description of this data package to be added shortly.**

> /api/mobile/sync?projectIds=1007,1009&ifModifiedSince=2019-12-15T15:23:12Z

Authenticated: Yes

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Notes |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| projectIds | String | Yes | A comma delimated list of project Ids |
| ifModifiedSince | String | No | A ISO-8601 formatted datetime (eg: 2020-01-12T15:30:23Z) |

**Return JSON attributes:**


| Attribute | Type | Notes |
| --------- | ---- | ----- |
| entryPoint | String | The entry point suffix to call |
| projectId | Integer | A project Id |
| checklistId | Integer | A checklist Id |
| statprov | Integer | A 2-letter province code |
| protocolId | Integer | A protocol Id |
| regionId | Integer | A region Id |

Any attributes that are present and not null should be used to:

1. delete records from appropriate tables in the local cache
2. query the api to get replacement records for those deleted.




## Errors ##

Errors generated in the API will result in a JSON encoded error structure,
returned with an appropriate HTTP error status. 

**Return JSON attributes:**

| Attribute | Notes |
| --------- | ----- |
| entryPoint | The api entry point that was queried |
| error | An http error code: also present as the response 'Status Code' |
| msgCode | A character code for this error. Lowercase letters and dashes only. |
| errorMsgs | An array of textual error message(s), detailing the condition |

You may retrieve the current error codes and messages with the following entrypoint.

> /api/mobile/errorCodes?token=asdfasdf



## Reference Data ##



Reference data should be cached locally in the app, with a provision for periodic updates (weekely, etc?) and
for a complete forced refresh. The `data_version` parameter returned by the `/api/mobile/dataVersion` entrypoint above should be
checked against a stored value: if this value changes, a complete refresh of Reference Data is in order.

Reference data are returned as a JSON object with a single element `'items'`, which
is an array of JSON objects. Each object corresponds to a single data record.


Reference Data queries do not require user authentication, but may include a `lang` 
parameter. If the `lang` paramter is not provided, it will default to `EN`.

| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----- |

**Important notes:**

There is an important distinction between primary and children survey events. When the protocol allows a subProtocolId, additional events 
(e.g. point counts) can be submitted within the main event. The primary event (called station) always gets assigned a stationId = 0. Linked events,
identified with a subProtocolId, will have stationId of 1 or greater (each should be unique, and assigned in the order of creation by the user).

When protocols allow sub-protocols, they may have a stationId 0 or not (as determined by the protocol field called hasStation0). In cases where there
is both a stationId 0 and sub-protocols, the station 0 would contain all observations NOT already tabulated in other stations (so the total of all
count values in all stations including station 0 would provide the actual total number of birds seen). However, for all of the other fields
(e.g. duration and distance), the values assigned to station 0 would apply to the entire checklist.

In cases where there is no station 0 allowed in the protocol, this indicates that the participant would only report observations at individual points,
but not those made in between. E.g. a roadside survey with 5 minute points every km. In those cases, the survey would start immediately at station 1,
and rather than return to the main survey form (station 0) when the station is completed, the user would have to option of ending the checklist 
or adding an additional station.

Preferably, when looking at station 0, the tally of observations reported on other stations would be visible to the user but not editable.

For the moment, each speciesId within a station should be unique. I.E., only one record per species within a station. In the future, some protocols
will need to support multiple entries per species (e.g. one record per individual bird), as well as additional fields (e.g. distance to bird, bearing).

There will be additional variables that we may want to support in the future, but that are not relevant to protocols identified as priorities.

Stations:
	roadside (whether the survey was conducted on a roadside)
	trafficCount (numbers of vehicles counted during the survey event)
	noiseLevel (code representing the background noise level)
	distanceFromStart (distance in km between the start of the checklist and the current station)
